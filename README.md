Creating a code quiz

This is a simple 5 question quiz. Each question is displayed one at a time so once you answer one question, the next will display. You have 75 seconds to get through the quiz. Good Luck!

1. Create a homepage with a start button functionality to describe and explain the quiz
2. Create a 5 question quiz that the user has to go through and answer questions within the given timeframe.
3. Once the quiz is over, share the calculated results with the user and have them put in their initials.
4. On the final page, display the scores of the players with their initials.
5. With 2 buttons allow the following:
   a. Replay by returning to the homepage to start over.
   b. Clear the results
